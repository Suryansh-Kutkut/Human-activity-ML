Explanation
Data Loading: We load the dataset using Pandas and explore its basic properties to understand its structure.

Data Visualization: We use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations that help us see the distribution of activities and feature correlations.

Data Preprocessing: We split the dataset into features and target variables, then scale the features for better model performance.

Model Building: We choose a Random Forest Classifier and train it using the training dataset.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics.

Model Saving: We save the trained model using Joblib for future use.


Achievements:

Data Preprocessing: Successfully cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values and scaling features to ensure optimal model performance.

Model Development: Implemented multiple machine learning models, including:

Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 94% on the test dataset, indicating a highly reliable model for activity recognition.
Logistic Regression: Used to understand the linear relationship between features and activities, achieving an accuracy of 88%.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Applied for classification with an accuracy of 91%.
Performance Evaluation:

Generated comprehensive performance metrics, including confusion matrices and classification reports, to assess model accuracy and precision.
Optimized model parameters using cross-validation and grid search to enhance classification performance.
